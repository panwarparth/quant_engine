 Quant Engine

A modular **Quantitative Trading Engine** built from scratch using Python.

Designed to be **backtestable, extensible**, and educational â€” this system models real-world trading architecture including:

-  Historical data handling
-  Strategy layer (momentum-based to start)
-  Execution simulator (vectorized backtester)
-  Risk management (Sharpe, VaR, Kelly)
-  Performance visualization
